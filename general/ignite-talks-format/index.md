## Ignite talks overview
{: class="center" }

If you have a strong message that you really want to share with the Mobile Delivery world, we encourage you to send us a proposal for an Ignite presentation. 

These are 5 minute talks with 20 slides that auto-advance. If you aren't familiar with the format, good examples can be found at [http://igniteshow.com/](http://igniteshow.com)

Tell us about tools, processes, tips, tricks, war stories, whatever... make us laugh, make us cry, show us how to be more awesome.

The only rule is don't give a straight sales pitch. That's not even a rule we'll enforce, everyone will just think you are uncool... that is punishment enough.
