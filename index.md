Struggling with **Mobile App delivery**? We feel your pain!

The tooling is still Work In Progress, and detailed technical stories are hard to find.

We believe we need to start talking about *the complete mobile delivery toolchain*:

## **From automated app testing over publishing and running it into production, supporting it and all the way back to delivering business insights.**

That's why [we are organizing](/contact) this conference.

Come share your knowledge, learn from your peers, advance our field.
