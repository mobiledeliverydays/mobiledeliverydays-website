**Call for Proposals closes by 28 February**

We have 4 ways to get you involved in sharing your story:

<ol>
  <li><strong><em>A proposal for a talk/panel</em></strong> during the conference part : these are 40 minute slots that will have all people's full attention as everybody will be in that one room.</li>
  <li><strong><em>An Ignite talk</em></strong> that will be presented during the<a href="/general/ignite-talks-format"> Ignite sessions</a>: these are 5 minutes slots with slides changing every 15 seconds (20 slides total) also presented to all attendees in one room</li>
  <li><strong><em>Openspace session</em></strong> : even without a prepared presentation we welcome the discussion and interaction by having people propose a session on the fly during the openspace opening. Check the <a href="/general/open-space-format">openspace format</a> for more information
  <li><strong><em>Suggest a speaker,topic</em></strong> : Come on, don't be shy. We know you've always wanted a person to give their own view on a specific subject.  Now's your chance and we might make it happen.
</ol>

## Topic advice
- try not to limit yourself to 1 mobile technology
- we like things at scale
- we like practical advice but don't expect a one, two , three step like tutortial
- we don't like vendor specific solutions, abstract the solution into a more generic applicable lesson
- we love demos but shy away from vendor propaganda

## How to submit?
- send your proposal by email to [info@mobiledeliverydays.org](mailto:info@mobiledeliverydays.org?subject=proposal+mobile+delivery+days)
