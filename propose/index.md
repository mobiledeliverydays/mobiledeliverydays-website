## Call for Proposals closes February 28th

There are four ways for you to share your story:

<ol>
  <li><strong><em>A proposal for a talk/panel</em></strong> during the conference. These are 40-minute slots that will have everyone's attention as everybody will be in the same room.</li>
  <li><strong><em>An Ignite talk</em></strong> that will be presented during the <a href="/general/ignite-talks-format"> Ignite sessions</a>. These are five-minute slots with slides changing every 15 seconds (20 slides total) presented to all attendees in the same room</li>
  <li><strong><em>An Openspace session</em></strong> that will occur during the <a href="/general/open-space-format">openspace sessions</a>. Even without a prepared presentation we welcome discussion and interaction by having people propose sessions on the fly.
  <li><strong><em>Suggest a speaker or topic</em></strong>. Come on, don't be shy. We know you've always wanted someone to give their own view on a specific subject. Now's your chance and we might make it happen.
</ol>

## Topic advice
- Try not to limit yourself to one mobile technology.
- We like things at scale.
- We like practical advice but don't expect a one-, two-, or three-step tutorial.
- We don't like vendor specific solutions. Abstract the solution into a more generic, applicable lesson.
- We love demos but shy away from vendor propaganda.

## How to submit?
- Send your proposal by email to [info@mobiledeliverydays.org](mailto:info@mobiledeliverydays.org?subject=proposal+mobile+delivery+days)
- Include a clear title and subtitle.
- Write at least a few sentences about what you intend to present. The more detail the better.
- Be sure to cover what the audience is going to get from the talk.
- Describe the target audience and experience level.
- Add any notes we should know as organizers.
- Include links to previous presentations or blog posts.
