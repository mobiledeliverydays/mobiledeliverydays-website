Continuous integration is old hat in the web frontend and backend world, but it’s still rare for native mobile apps. 
For true continuous integration, we ship every commit directly to production – but this is clearly not realistic in the world of native apps, 
where binaries must be published in the App Store (with Apple’s week-long review process) and Google Play, 
then downloaded by members. 

On the engineering side, we needed an aggressive goal to ensure we didn’t fall back into the pattern of manual verification of each release. 
We also wanted our product partners to be free to ship as often as they want (without annoying members of course!). We settled on a rule that we call “3x3”.
