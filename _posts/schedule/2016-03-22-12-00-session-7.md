In this talk I'll  challenge what developers and devops consider things that belong in the code, what are the benefits for extracting concerns from the development life cycle and what approaches are we already seeing used.
Among other I will explore different techniques companies are already taking (home grown solutions) and motivation for companies to create a software decoration framework running on devices for the purposes of A/B testing, 
dynamic analytics and gradually releasing features. 

The client side architecture that runs your code on multiple remote devices introduce new challenges but also new opportunities in how we view production code and how it is released. 
We will explore the new role of production control and how such systems enable devops tools management without the need to disrupt the development cycle and development team, 
we will show examples of profiling, logging, debugging, root cause analysis and customer support that are introduced to the system without the need for a release. (with real life examples)
