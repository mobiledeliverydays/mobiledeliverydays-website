All of us want to deliver quickly and often to our customers but even at best effort it requires a big amount of time to get a release out. Usually it goes like this: merge every new feature into master, build the different release APKs. Check it manually if it works on arm & x86 cpu architecture. Check if it performs well and every feature works as intended. Check that every text is translated, even the description... and the checklist continues until you uploaded everything into the Play Store and pushed the publish button. A few months ago this process took a day for us every time we released. But now it doesnâ€™t take any time. It is automated. When we push a new feature into the master branch the new version of the app appears on our beta channel automatically.

This talk is our story how we suffered, fought and eliminated the unpleasant manual work of releasing. And how we made possible for our Product Manager tor release the new features whenever she wants by pushing a button. The whole story will be presented as it is, so at the end of the talk you will know how to build this for your company.
