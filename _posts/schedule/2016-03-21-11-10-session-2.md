Most, if not all, apps should be international these daysâ€”but outsourcing localized strings is just the start. 
In particular, some languages read from right to left, and this can have far-reaching implications for your user interface.  Developers, testers, and PMs alike can all learn about RTL support, how to test it, and of course how to automate those tests. 
This way, their users that read those languages can all have a compelling (and regression-free) experience in an app that was designed to fit their expectations.
